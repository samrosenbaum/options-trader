# Debug Empty Results - Check Render Logs

## I Just Pushed Diagnostic Logging

**Commit:** `6a0f76f` - "Add diagnostic logging to scanner policy check"

This adds extensive logging to show EXACTLY what's happening when you click scan.

---

## Wait for Deployment (5-10 min)

1. Check Render Dashboard ‚Üí "Money Printer" service
2. Wait for it to show **"Live"** with latest commit
3. Once deployed, proceed to next step

---

## Test and Check Logs

### Step 1: Trigger a Scan
1. Go to Money Printer app
2. Click "Scan"

### Step 2: Immediately Check Render Logs
1. Go to Render Dashboard ‚Üí "Money Printer"
2. Click **"Logs"** tab
3. Look for these log messages:

**What to look for:**
```
üîç Checking scanner execution policy...
Environment: { ... }
```

**Then EITHER:**
```
‚ùå FORCED FALLBACK TRIGGERED: { forceFallback: true, reason: "...", details: "..." }
```

**OR:**
```
‚úÖ No fallback policy - Python scanner will run
```

---

## Send Me the Logs

**Copy and paste the relevant log section** showing:
1. The "üîç Checking scanner execution policy..." line
2. The Environment object
3. Either the "‚ùå FORCED FALLBACK" or "‚úÖ No fallback policy" line
4. Any other error messages

This will tell us EXACTLY what's wrong.

## Possible Issues

### If You See "‚ùå FORCED FALLBACK"
- One of the environment checks is still triggering
- The logs will show which one and why
- I'll fix it immediately

### If You See "‚úÖ No fallback policy"
- The policy check passed
- But Python process might be failing to start
- OR there's an error in the scanner itself
- Logs will show Python errors if any

### If You See Neither
- Something else is wrong earlier in the flow
- Possibly cache returning empty results
- Send me all the logs you see

---

## While You Wait

The deployment takes 5-10 minutes. Once it's "Live":
1. Click Scan
2. Copy logs
3. Send them to me
4. I'll fix the real issue immediately

---

We'll get this working. The logs will tell us exactly what's wrong.
