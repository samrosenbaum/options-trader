# 🚨 CRITICAL BUG FOUND - Missing `os` Import

## The Bug

**Error in cron logs:**
```
Error in _enhance_opportunity for ADBE: name 'os' is not defined
```

**This was causing 100% failure:**
- Scanner found 20 opportunities ✅
- ALL 20 failed during enhancement ❌
- Final result: 0 opportunities ❌

## The Fix

**Commit `1824930`:**
- Added `import os` to top-level imports in `enhanced_service.py`
- Was only imported inside a function, causing NameError in other functions

## What This Fixes

**Before:**
```
📊 Limiting output to top 20 of 446 opportunities
🔍 Enhancing 20 opportunities with institutional-grade analysis...
Error in _enhance_opportunity for ADBE: name 'os' is not defined
Error in _enhance_opportunity for ZM: name 'os' is not defined
...
📋 Before institutional filtering: 0 opportunities  ← ALL FAILED
```

**After (expected):**
```
📊 Limiting output to top 20 of 446 opportunities
🔍 Enhancing 20 opportunities with institutional-grade analysis...
✅ Enhanced all 20 opportunities
📋 Before institutional filtering: 20 opportunities
📊 After institutional filtering: 10-20 opportunities  ← SUCCESS
```

## Multiple Fixes Deployed

**1. Missing `os` import** (Commit `1824930`) ← THE BIG ONE
- Was breaking ALL opportunities
- Now fixed

**2. Composite score filter disabled** (Commit `b819de8`)
- Was rejecting 70% before institutional filters
- Now set to 0.0 (disabled)

**3. Relaxed filters** (Commit `b819de8`)
- Liquidity: volume > 10, OI > 25
- Institutional: prob >= 1%, score >= 5
- More opportunities can pass through

**4. Performance** (Commit `b819de8`)
- 25 symbols (was 20)
- 60-day lookback (was 90)
- Should complete in 3-4 minutes instead of 15+

## Timeline

- **Now (~11:15am)**: Fixes deployed to GitHub
- **11:20-11:25am**: Render rebuilds web service + cron
- **Next cron run** (every :00, :10, :20, :30, :40, :50):
  - Scanner completes with 10-20 opportunities
  - Saves to Supabase cache
- **Click "Scan"**: Serves cached results (<2 sec)

## Why Scanner Was Slow (907 seconds)

The cron logs show it was still running with OLD config:
- 20 symbols (not 25)
- 90-day lookback (not 60)
- Missing `os` import causing errors + retries

Once new deployment takes effect:
- 25 symbols
- 60-day lookback
- No errors
- **Should complete in 3-4 minutes**

## Why UI Shows 0 Even With Cache

The cron successfully saved "0 opportunities" to cache because all 20 failed enhancement.

Once the next cron runs WITH the fix:
- Will save 10-20 opportunities to cache
- UI will show them immediately

## Next Scan Should Show

**Wait ~10-15 minutes for:**
1. Render to rebuild (5-10 min)
2. Next cron run to complete (3-4 min)
3. Cache to populate with 10-20 opportunities

**Then click "Scan"** and you should see results.
