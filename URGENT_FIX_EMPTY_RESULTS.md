# ðŸš¨ URGENT FIX: Scanner Returning Empty Results

## The Problem

The scanner is immediately returning EMPTY results because it's detecting Render environment but missing the `PYTHON_EXECUTABLE` environment variable.

### What's Happening

1. Render sets `RENDER=true` for all services
2. Scanner checks if `PYTHON_EXECUTABLE` environment variable exists
3. If missing â†’ **Forces fallback mode** (which returns empty opportunities array)
4. Scanner never actually runs

**Location:** `lib/server/scanner-runtime.ts` lines 65-76

---

## ðŸ”§ THE FIX (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Add PYTHON_EXECUTABLE to Render

1. Go to **Render Dashboard**
2. Click on **"Money Printer"** (your web service, NOT the cron job)
3. Click **"Environment"** tab in left sidebar
4. Click **"Add Environment Variable"**
5. Add:
   ```
   Key: PYTHON_EXECUTABLE
   Value: python3
   ```
6. Click **"Save Changes"**

### Step 2: Wait for Redeploy

- Render will automatically redeploy (takes 5-10 min)
- Once it shows "Live", the scanner will work

### Step 3: Test

1. Go to Money Printer app
2. Click "Scan"
3. Wait 3-4 minutes
4. **Should see 10-20 opportunities** (not empty!)

## Why This Happened

The code has a safety check to prevent running Python scanner in serverless environments (Vercel, AWS Lambda, etc.) that don't support subprocesses.

Render DOES support Python, but the check is overly cautious and disables the scanner if `PYTHON_EXECUTABLE` isn't explicitly set.

---

## Alternative Quick Fix (If Above Doesn't Work)

If setting PYTHON_EXECUTABLE doesn't work, I can push a code fix to remove this check for Render environments.

Let me know and I'll push it immediately.

## What You'll See After Fix

**Before (now):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "opportunities": [],
  "source": "enhanced-fallback",
  "fallback": true,
  "fallbackReason": "render_serverless"
}
```

**After (with fix):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "opportunities": [
    { "symbol": "TSLA", "score": 67, ... },
    { "symbol": "AMD", "score": 52, ... },
    ... 10-20 opportunities
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "totalEvaluated": 2450,
    "symbolsScanned": ["TSLA", "AMD", ...]
  }
}
```

## ðŸš¨ DO THIS NOW

**Add `PYTHON_EXECUTABLE=python3` to your Render web service environment variables.**

Then wait 10 minutes for redeploy and test again.

If it still doesn't work, ping me immediately and I'll push a code fix.
