# Unstoppable Options Intelligence Blueprint

## Vision
Build an institutional-grade options intelligence platform that continuously harvests high-probability, asymmetric trades by combining institutional-quality data, advanced quantitative detection, explainable narratives, and automated execution safeguards.

The target state delivers:
- **Always-on market coverage** across equities, ETFs, and index options with sub-minute updates.
- **Statistically defensible anomaly scores** that reflect volatility regimes, dealer positioning, and structural mispricings.
- **Narrative-quality explanations** that translate quant outputs into human decisions and automate alerting/CRM workflows.
- **Closed-loop validation** through live performance telemetry, backtests, and risk controls.

## Capability Pillars & Build Sequence

| Pillar | What "Unstoppable" Looks Like | Near-Term Objectives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data Infrastructure | Normalized, low-latency chain snapshots; persistent historical greeks & trades; replayable market tapes. | 1. Finalize Polygon/Tradier adapters with resilience & retries.<br>2. Ship Postgres/Timescale migrations + ingestion workers.<br>3. Implement cache + queue layer (Redis/Celery or Dramatiq) for scalable polling. |
| Quant & Detection | Ensemble of orthogonal factors (IV z-score, skew, gamma, mispricing, flow) with probabilistic calibration. | 1. Finish IV anomaly module hardening (more history guards, RV calc).<br>2. Implement gamma exposure + squeeze scoring.<br>3. Add skew deviation and IV–RV spread scorers.<br>4. Bundle into weighted `AnomalyScorer` with significance voting. |
| Explainability & UX | Multi-channel narratives, real-time dashboards, actionable drilldowns. | 1. Create templated explainer service (Jinja2) with HTML + Markdown outputs.<br>2. Add historical outcome statistics & scenario tables.<br>3. Modernize Next.js dashboard with WebSocket feed, filters, and risk badges. |
| Operations & Trust | Alert routing, backtesting, risk dashboards, capital allocation simulator. | 1. Build alert dispatcher (email/Telegram/webhook) with cooldown + dedupe.<br>2. Stand up backtest engine (entry/exit rules, capital tracking).<br>3. Instrument telemetry (Prometheus + Grafana or OpenTelemetry) for latency & hit-rate tracking. |

## 90-Day Roadmap (4 Sprints)

### Sprint 1 – Data Backbone (Weeks 1–2)
- Implement vendor adapters with retry/backoff, pagination, and contract filtering.
- Ship `migrations/001_create_schema.sql` + SQLModel/SQLAlchemy ORM for ingestion.
- Build async ingestion workers that populate `options_contracts` and `options_snapshots` tables.
- Add pytest coverage for adapters (mock vendor responses) and storage writes.

**Definition of Done:** Historical chain replay works for at least 50 tickers; daily job backfills 6 months of IV & greeks.

### Sprint 2 – Quant Engine (Weeks 3–4)
- Harden `IVAnomalyScorer` (historical IV loader, min sample-size constraints, fallback percentiles).
- Implement `GammaSqueezeDetector`, `SkewDeviationScorer`, and `IVRVSpreadScorer` with unit tests.
- Create `MispricingDetector` to scan put-call parity and butterfly opportunities.
- Wire everything into `AnomalyScorer` with configuration-driven weights and consensus requirements.

**Definition of Done:** Backtest on Jan 2021 (GME/AMC) and Feb 2020 (COVID crash) surfaces known events with >90 scores.

### Sprint 3 – Explainability & Delivery (Weeks 5–6)
- Build `ExplanationGenerator` with templated executive summary, catalyst, risk, and trade mechanics sections.
- Expose structured factor metadata (scores, z-scores, gamma magnitudes) for templating and UI.
- Launch Next.js dashboard refresh: real-time feed, filter panel, expandable signal cards, greeks tables.
- Integrate multi-channel alert dispatcher (email, Telegram, webhook) using explanation HTML/Markdown.

**Definition of Done:** Real-time scanner publishes alerts with full narrative and dashboards reflect updates within 5 seconds.

### Sprint 4 – Validation & Automation (Weeks 7–8)
- Implement asynchronous backtester with configurable exit logic and capital allocation.
- Generate Plotly HTML reports (equity curve, drawdowns, distribution) automatically after each backtest run.
- Add performance telemetry pipeline: store live signal outcomes, compute hit rates, calibrate expected returns.
- Layer on risk controls: max open trades, sector exposure caps, throttle on drawdown.

**Definition of Done:** Daily backtest + live PnL dashboard accessible; alerts gated by risk guardrails.

## Immediate Next Workstream (Post-IV Anomaly PR)
1. **Data Plumbing:** Finish ingestion job that stores historical IV per strike so IV z-scores remain reliable.<br>   _Owners:_ Data/Backend. _Artifacts:_ `src/storage/postgres.py`, `tests/storage/test_ingest.py`.
2. **Gamma Modeling:** Kick off `GammaSqueezeDetector` implementation (dealer gamma estimation, gamma-flip level, squeeze severity) with tests.<br>   _Owners:_ Quant Engineering. _Artifacts:_ `src/scoring/gamma_squeeze.py`, `tests/scoring/test_gamma_squeeze.py`.
3. **Skew & IV–RV Spread:** Draft spec for skew z-scores and realized vol calculators; define DB requirements for realized vol histories.<br>   _Owners:_ Quant + Data Science. _Artifacts:_ design doc + prototypes in `notebooks/` (optional).
4. **Explainability Prep:** Start schema for factor metadata (e.g., `SignalFactor` dataclass) so scorers emit consistent payloads.<br>   _Owners:_ Platform. _Artifacts:_ `src/models/signal.py`, `tests/models/test_signal.py`.

## Key Risks & Mitigations
- **Data Latency / Vendor Limits:** Introduce adaptive polling, concurrency caps, and local caching to stay within rate limits.
- **Statistical Drift:** Schedule nightly recalibration jobs to recompute z-score baselines and validate factor stability.
- **False Positives:** Require multi-factor confirmation and integrate backtest-derived priors into scoring thresholds.
- **Operational Complexity:** Containerize services (Docker Compose) and standardize observability to simplify deployment.

## Success Metrics
- **Precision & Recall:** ≥65% win rate for signals scored ≥85 over rolling 90 days; <20% false-positive rate.
- **Time-to-Insight:** <10 seconds from vendor update to alert dispatch for top-tier signals.
- **Coverage:** Monitor ≥500 tickers with <5% gap rate during market hours.
- **Explainability Adoption:** ≥80% of alerts consumed without manual analyst intervention (based on feedback tooling).

Delivering on this blueprint transforms the scanner from heuristic alerts into an always-learning, explainable, and risk-aware trading co-pilot.
